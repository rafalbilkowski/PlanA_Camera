## Troubleshoot
- Can't find video0 
	- check if the i2c bus is normal
		- add dtparam=i2c_vc=on to /boot/config.txt,then reboot 
		- run i2cdetect -y 0 to check the devive's address.
		- if it does not detect the device's address, please check the ribbon cable connection to ensure it is not reversed.
